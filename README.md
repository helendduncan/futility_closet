# Futility Closet

A collection of interesting things I've found - name inspired by the fantastic podcast

Here I aim to keep some interesting ideas and associated code. 

Each page should be its own topic, but that may change. Furthermore, this is an excuse to practice package management, CI/CD, gitHub actions and best practices (Ã  la Turing way).
I think it will also be a nice way to trial some new-to-me data visualisation techniques.
